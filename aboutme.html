            Hello, I'm Kea--a PhD student in the Department of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Berkeley. I specialize in Egyptology, and right now my passion is funerary arts, specifically coffin production. I'm also a digital humanist and am always looking for new ways to use technology to answer my research questions. Right now, I'm especially interested in image processing.
