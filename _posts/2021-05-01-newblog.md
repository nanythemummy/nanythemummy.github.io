Hello, I'm Kea--a PhD student in the Department of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Berkeley. I specialize in Egyptology, and right now my passion is funerary arts, specifically coffin production. I'm also a digital humanist and am always looking for new ways to use technology, especially image processing, to answer my research questions.

On this blog, I'll talk about all the little extra-curricular projects that I work on, which I do in the little time when I'm not writing my PhD dissertation. I'm making this for several reasons. Firstly, I'm going to be going on the job market soon, and my skill as a software engineer are rusty. I'm knowledgeable on the "old-hotness" of seven years ago when I started on the PhD adventure. Really, I need to learn something new(er) and useful, so I thought I'd use this opportunity to learn <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"> Jekyll </a>.

Secondly, I have a lot of projects that I've worked on as a side to my dissertation. They've informed my knowledge of Ancient Egyptian technology, but aren't really a big enough deal to write a paper about. I've posted about them in a series of instagram and facebook posts that have been fairly popular, and I decided that they needed to be crystalized into something more permanent.
I'll be starting this blog by revisiting those projects.
