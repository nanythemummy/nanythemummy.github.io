title: Wrapping a "Mummy"

<p> Last fall, I was writing a section of my dissertaion about the actual craft of making coffins. I ended up reading a lot of papers on conservation of Egyptian coffins, and I had conversations via email with a lot of people who are really knowledgeable about how coffins were decorated (whose work I'll mention further in later entries). However, if you are going to make a small coffin or cartonnage, you had best have a "mummy" to go in it! So off I went to the discount store to find a cheap Barbie-knockoff to turn into a Sah (an idealized mummified divinity). </p>

<p>I finally decided on a small but articulated skeleton from a Halloween display. Afterall, many of the occupants of the coffins that I study--the ones from post-new-kingdom Akhmim, really aren't very well mummified. We can pretend that our skeleton, while clearly a member of the elite, had limited resources, and chose to put them all into wrapping and a nice coffin rather than mummification. </p>

<p> I decided to use a 1906 account of the unwarpping of a mummy of a 21st dynasty priestess as a guide for how to wrap my skeleton, whose name is (as of 5 minutes ago) Neferqesut. The author of the account, Egyptologist Grafton Elliot Smith, was involved in the unwrapping of many of the occupants of a tomb now called Bab el-Gasus. This tomb was carved from the rock hundreds of years before being used as a communal burial place for priests of the god Amun at Thebes (modern Luxor).  </p>
<p>These priests lived in the 21st dynasty, (roughly 1075 to 950 BCE) a time of political fragmentation and economic collapse in Egypt. To view this time (the Third Intermediate Period) as a dark-ages would be incorrect, however. Like many transitional eras, it was a time of great artistic and religious/philosophical innovation. Because they no longer had the resources and infrastructure to protect the painted tombs that their ancestors enjoyed, the elite of the 21st dynasty put their resources into brilliantly painted coffins and sophisticated embalming techniques designed to make the deceased as lifelike as possible (Cooney, 20011). 
</p>
<p> I wanted to get an idea of what aspects of wrapping a body held the embalmers' attention and why. These details do not really come accross in the written accounts of unwrapping, which tend to be a bit of a tedious, boring read. However, I appreciated the detail of Smith's account when it came to reconstructing his steps. Smith gave the measurements of every piece of cloth that he unwound from the mummy of Ta-wosret-im-per-nesu. 
</p>
<p>To wrap the body, the Egyptians used linen. This linen came from a variety of sources--sometimes, it came from clothing which was probably worn by the deceased and saved by themselves or their relatives. Somteimes, if the person was important, they were wrapped with cloth that belonged to the temple and might have been used to clothe the statue of the god. Neferqesut, however, will have to settle with a small amount of leftover muslin and an old bedsheet.</p>
<p>
If you want to watch my step-by-step wrapping process, I've made a video of it available here. I even gave him some "amulets" and a little Amduat papyrus.</p>

<p>What I did not realize was how much effort went into creating the <i>shape</i> of an idealized mummiform figure out of a very reduced and dessicated human body. When the mummification process was completed, the remains would have had a lot of sunken and hollow areas that a living person wouldn't have. The idealized wrapped mummy from Egyptian art didn't have these hollows, either--it was a wrapped but full human form. Making this ideal a reality involved lots of padding around the head, and also around the buttocks, belly, and thighs.

<p>What was also surprising, but probably shoulnd't have been, is just how much textile it took to wrap a skeleton which was a little over a foot tall. I used some really rough calculations based on the ratio of the size of my skeleton to the size that Smith gave for Ta-wosret-im-per-nesu's body to calculate a scale factor of 1/4. I then divided all of Smith's heights and widths of bandages by 4, and ripped/cut the resulting sizes out of my fabric. I still managed to use up about two queen bedsheets worth of fabric for a foot-high plastic skeleton.  If you think that every piece of linen clothing was hand spun and hand woven, then you can get an idea of just how extravagant and costly wrapping a mummy was for the Egyptians.</p>
<p>
In short, I suppose I didn't get anything out of this that I could not have gotten from a close, thoughful reading of an account of an unwrapping. However, reproducing the wrapping process focused my attention on aspects which I would have otherwise missed, such as the importance of the shape of the final product, and the sheer amount of fabric that went into wrapping the body.
